version 0.002; 2006-08-03

  * bugfix: in mult_pow2(), copysign(), and nextafter(), take care
    to return a pristine signed zero when returning zero: they were
    returning zeroes that got broken (due to the Perl bug noted in the
    documentation) by internal arithmetic

version 0.001; 2006-08-01

  * add IEEE 754 functions copysign() and nextafter()

  * test sign of zero using sprintf() to avoid being confused by dualvars

  * slight expansion of initial paragraph of documentation

version 0.000; 2006-07-30

  * initial released version
